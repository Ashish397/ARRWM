                <div class="row-prompt">A serene, picturesque scene of an elderly woman living in a quaint, weathered wooden cottage surrounded by lush greenery and tall trees. She leans forward slightly in her rocking chair, reaching out to pluck a fallen leaf from the porch floor, its veins glowing silver in the moonlight. The moon casts a soft glow over the tranquil landscape, highlighting the distant hills and the twinkling stars above. The rustle of leaves and a distant owl hoot blend with the gentle creak of the rocking chair. mediumâ€‘close static</div>
