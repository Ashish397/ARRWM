    "interactive-action.mp4": `0s-10s: Nighttime streets blaze with neon on rain-slick asphalt as the camera hurtles into a high-speed chase. Headlights smear by, engines snarl, and two cars drift side by side through knife-thin alleys, kicking up sheets of water.
10s-20s: The chase bursts onto the freeway. A fuel truck erupts, hurling flaming debris while the cars knife through shockwaves and falling metal.
20s-30s: Sound cuts out into a stark flashback: the city by day, still and cold. The protagonist passes a data drive to an ally in a dim warehouse.
30s-40s: The memory snaps away to a shadowed parking garage. The protagonist jumps from a rolling car as enemies close in under flickering fluorescents and a surge of score.

At center frame a silver-gray house cat trots briskly across the leaf-strewn ground, tail flicking as a cool breeze swirls more leaves across the lens.
10s-20s: The setting holds as the cat bounds toward the treeline, leaping a fallen log. Mid-stride it lengthens and darkens into a smoky brown wildcat, tufted ears and lean muscles propelling it forward through drifting leaves.
20s-30s: The sky warms toward amber while the wildcat splashes across the stream. Its frame broadens, fur shifts to deep russet, and it flows into a sleek red fox whose plume tail catches the light as it speeds ahead.
30s-40s: Twilight settles. The fox races across the bridge, chest deepening and coat graying until it becomes a gray wolf, galloping through the clearing and over the stream toward the hillside.
40s-50s: Moonlight cools the scene. The wolf’s limbs refine and fur shortens to tawny as it transforms into a swift antelope, horns budding as it bounds between trees and clears the stream in a single leap.
50s-60s: Under the bright moon the antelope grows taller and heavier, coat richening to chestnut. It resolves into a powerful horse that gallops toward the horizon, mane flying and hooves ringing on leaf-strewn earth, completing the seamless cat-to-horse progression.`,

10s-20s: Same forward glide into summer: canopy deepens to jade as heavy rain sheets down, bouncing off broad leaves, puddles rippling to distant thunder.
20s-30s: Without a cut into autumn: leaves turn gold and rust; a cool gust sends them skittering across an amber-lit floor as rows of bamboo bend and rustle.
30s-40s: Seamlessly to winter: silver snow dusts the canopy, frost rims each leaf, flakes drift, and dark trunks glaze to a quiet, crystalline sheen.
40s-50s: Back to spring: snowmelt beads into sparkle, bamboo brightens to soft emerald, and tiny buds unfurl in misty dawn light.
50s-60s: Loop to summer: lush green returns; a gentle rain begins, drops pattering into mirrored pools as the steady glide completes the cycle.`,

20s-30s: A sleek futuristic spacecraft descends over the ridge. Metal skin glints; faint thrusters shimmer. Birds scatter as the camera tilts up to meet it—nature versus tech.
30s-40s: The ship hovers above the river, thrusters rippling the surface. Light shards off reflective panels; mist curls around the hull as the camera orbits to sell the scale.
40s-50s: Hatches open: small drones spill out and zip across the valley, catching sun in bright streaks. Cuts alternate between wide grandeur and tight drone close-ups.
50s-60s: The ship climbs, leaving glowing exhaust. Drones pause, then dock and vanish into the hull. Pull back to an epic wide of the untouched valley as the craft slips beyond the horizon.`,
    "interactive-couple.mp4": `0s-10s: Medium shot at sunset on a picturesque suburban street: a mid-20s woman with shoulder-length dark hair in a pastel spring coat, white blouse, slim jeans, and white sneakers walks hand-in-hand with her late-20s boyfriend in a sky-blue oxford, gray sweater vest, tan chinos, clean sneakers, slim leather watch.

A gaunt, mid-40s man with greasy black hair thrashes for air; tattered gray shirt and ripped trousers cling to his frame. Debris—rusted cans, plastic, river weed—drifts past; the handheld lens trembles with the current.
10s-20s: Same scene: he reaches upward with a trembling hand, fingertips slicing the turbid flow as if seeking the surface; clothes suctioned to sharp collarbones.
20s-30s: He clutches his chest as a spasm racks his torso; bubbles burst from his mouth while the current shivers the frame.
30s-40s: His hollow eyes track a jagged glass shard drifting by, its edge briefly catching a faint glow; rags ripple against skeletal limbs.
