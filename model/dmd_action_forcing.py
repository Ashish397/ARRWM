"""DMD2 model for Phase-1 Action-Forcing training (NO STAIRCASE).

This model is a thin, action-aware port of
``Causal-Forcing/model/dmd.py`` onto our infrastructure. The core
training mechanics — generator_loss / critic_loss / _compute_kl_grad /
compute_distribution_matching_loss / _run_generator — mirror CF
1:1 with two action-aware additions and the DMD2 upgrades retained
from the staircase variant:

  * ``_run_generator`` builds a per-frame action conditioning dict
    (Stream A modulation + Stream B tokens) from the input ``gt_actions``
    and threads it through to the Action-Forcing training pipeline.
  * Real and fake scorers receive the same per-frame action conditioning
    on the *student's* predicted 21-frame video — no GT context, no KV
    cache, fully symmetric. The grad direction is purely
    ``(pred_fake - pred_real)`` on a noisy version of the student's
    output (CF parity).
  * ODE checkpoint loading + v14 LoRA loading + generator->fake_score
    mirroring + non-strict load with optional strict gate (DMD2 retained
    upgrades from the staircase model).
  * Auxiliary action heads (``action_critic`` + ``state_probe``) are
    instantiated and loaded from the ODE checkpoint so the existing
    trainer plumbing (`action_token_projection`, etc.) keeps working,
    but their AUX LOSSES ARE NOT WIRED IN by this model — the user's
    plan for Phase-1 Action-Forcing is "DMD almost exactly like CF" so we keep
    only the DMD path. The heads remain frozen and unused by the
    losses; they live on the model only so the ODE checkpoint loads
    cleanly and downstream tooling that introspects `.action_critic`
    / `.state_probe` does not break.

The Action-Forcing training pipeline
``pipeline.action_forcing_training.ActionForcingTrainingPipeline``
runs the truncated random-exit denoise loop with persistent KV cache
and exit-flag gradient gating; ``_run_generator`` matches CF's
"slice last N frames" and ``start_gradient_frame_index`` semantics.

CF-style long rollouts (``rollout_frames > num_training_frames``):
the trainer rolls out ``rollout_frames`` total but only the LAST
``num_training_frames`` frames carry gradient (the gate inside
``ActionForcingTrainingPipeline.inference_with_trajectory`` runs the leading
``rollout_frames - num_training_frames`` exit-flag forwards under
``no_grad`` to warm the KV cache). After the rollout, this model
slices the pred to the LAST ``num_training_frames`` frames AND
slices the per-frame action streams in ``conditional_dict`` /
``unconditional_dict`` to the same window before passing to the
bidirectional scorer (whose seq_len is sized to
``num_training_frames``). When ``rollout_frames == num_training_frames``
(default), all of this is a no-op — every frame backprops.

CF-style first-chunk BOUNDARY mask (long-rollout mode only): the
first ``num_frame_per_block`` frames of the scoring window read
their attention context from the warmup KV cache (frames generated
under ``no_grad``); they are the "boundary" between warmup and
gradient-active regions. CF
(``Causal-Forcing/long_video/model/base.py:169-177``) zeros the
gradient on this first chunk so the student is not penalised for
the warmup→grad transition pattern. We do the same. We
deliberately SKIP CF's decode→re-encode anchoring of the boundary
frame: CF replaces the boundary latent with a freshly VAE-encoded
pixel frame; with the gradient masked off, the boundary frame's
contents cannot affect the loss, so the round-trip is wasted
compute. Mask is None when ``rollout_frames == num_training_frames``
(classic and pure-extension modes) — every scoring frame backprops.

        """Match CF's ``SelfForcingModel._run_generator`` behavior, plus
        CF-style long-rollout support and MAE-driven extension support:
          1. Sample fresh noise of shape ``[B, F, C, H, W]`` with
             F = ``rollout_frames`` (= ``num_training_frames`` by
             default; can be larger for long-rollout / "warmup the
             cache without grad" mode).
          2. Run ``inference_pipeline.inference_with_trajectory``. The
             pipeline's gradient gate
             ``start_gradient_frame_index = num_output_frames - num_max_frames``
             ensures only the LAST ``num_training_frames`` rolled
             frames carry gradient when ``rollout_frames >
             num_training_frames``. ``gt_latents=clean_latent`` enables
             the pipeline's MAE-extension loop when
             ``enable_mae_extension`` is True (caller-controlled —
             only the generator step opts in; the critic step skips
             extensions to avoid duplicating the metric collection).
          3. Slice the returned pred to its LAST ``num_training_frames``
             frames so the bidirectional scorer (whose seq_len is
             sized to ``num_training_frames``) sees only the
             gradient-active window. When ``rollout_frames ==
             num_training_frames`` this slice is a no-op.
          4. CF-style first-chunk boundary mask (long-rollout mode
             only): when ``rollout_frames > num_training_frames`` the
             leading ``num_frame_per_block`` frames of the
             ``num_training_frames`` scoring window receive context
             from the warmup KV cache (frames generated under
             ``no_grad`` to "warm" the cache). CF treats those
             leading scoring frames as a BOUNDARY: the gradient is
             masked off there so the student is not penalised for
             whatever transition pattern emerges between warmup-
             generated frames and the first grad-active block. We
             follow CF's mask logic byte-for-byte
             (``Causal-Forcing/long_video/model/base.py:169-177``)
             but DELIBERATELY SKIP CF's decode→re-encode round-trip
             (CF replaces the boundary frame with a fresh VAE-encoded
             pixel latent; we leave it as the student's raw latent
             since the gradient mask makes the boundary frame's
             content irrelevant to the loss anyway, and the round-
             trip is expensive — a full VAE decode + encode per
             training step). When ``rollout_frames ==
             num_training_frames`` (classic and pure-extension modes)
             the mask is None and every scoring frame backprops.
          5. Surface the pipeline's
             ``_last_extension_metrics`` dict (which is populated even
             when extensions are disabled, as long as ``gt_latents`` is
             provided — gives ``baseline_last_chunk_mae`` /
             ``last_chunk_mae`` always, ``mae_extension_count`` only
             on the generator step).

        Note on extensions: MAE extensions append no_grad chunks PAST
        the baseline rollout; they never enter the scoring window.
        So whether extensions fire or not is independent of the
        boundary mask — the mask is gated solely on
        ``rollout_frames > num_training_frames``.

        ``clean_x`` / ``aug_t`` are the FAKE-side view (pure clean GT,

        (``_compute_kl_grad``'s fake forwards AND ``critic_loss``'s
        fake-score training step). They are also the REAL-side view
        unless ``self.dmd_real_GT`` is True AND ``build_real_view`` is
        True, in which case ``clean_x_real`` / ``aug_t_real`` are a
        lightly noised version of the same GT (same shape, same memory
        — just one extra ``scheduler.add_noise`` call). When
        ``build_real_view`` is False the real-side outputs are
        ``None`` so the caller falls back on the fake-side view.

        ``critic_loss`` calls this helper with
        ``build_real_view=False`` because fake-score TRAINING never
        uses the real-side view (it only trains fake_score, not
        real_score), saving the noise computation.

        The cond dicts are SHALLOW-COPIED (never mutate the caller's

        ``image_or_video_shape`` is the BASELINE ROLLOUT shape
        (``[B, rollout_frames, C, H, W]``) — extensions are sampled
        inline by the pipeline, not from this noise. ``_run_generator``
        rolls the pipeline (potentially extending past ``rollout_frames``
        via the MAE-extension loop, all under no_grad), then slices the
        pred to the LAST ``num_training_frames`` of the BASELINE.
        ``conditional_dict`` / ``unconditional_dict`` per-frame streams
        may be longer than ``rollout_frames`` (sized to cover the max
        possible extended length); we slice them positionally to the
        baseline scoring window
        ``[rollout_frames - num_training_frames : rollout_frames]``
        before passing to the bidirectional scorer.

        Generator step opts INTO the MAE extension (passes
        ``enable_mae_extension=True``) and surfaces the per-call
        metrics from ``inference_pipeline._last_extension_metrics``
        into the log dict.

        ``clean_context_latents`` / ``clean_conditional_dict`` /
        ``clean_unconditional_dict`` are the v14 teacher-forcing
        inputs used ONLY when ``self.dmd_context=True``. The
        trainer is responsible for sourcing them from the ride
        (``ride_latents[:, :num_training_frames]`` and the
        action-streams cond dict built from ``ride_actions[:, :
        num_training_frames]``); they correspond to ride frames
        ``[0, num_training_frames)`` while the student's noisy
        rollout corresponds to ride frames ``[cf, cf +
        num_training_frames)`` where
        ``cf = dmd_context_clean_frames``. The scorer attends over
        both halves with ``context_shift = cf // npb`` to recreate
        v14's training time-alignment.

        When ``return_aux=True`` we additionally return an ``aux``
        dict carrying the rolled student prediction and the rung-
        exit timesteps, so a caller (the trainer) can plumb them
        into auxiliary loss paths (action critic / teacher z-
        guidance) without re-rolling the student. ``pred_image``
        is graph-carrying — its gradients are exactly what the
        DMD loss already feeds back through; the trainer should
        ``.detach()`` before passing into the critic-update branch
        and use the live tensor only for the gen-side guidance
        loss.

            x_te^(1) = Ψ_θ^{ts→te}(x_ts)
            x_te^(2) = Ψ_θ^{tm→te}(Ψ_θ^{ts→tm}(x_ts))

        and ``Ψ_θ^{a→b}`` is one Euler step of the student's
        velocity field from noise level ``a`` to ``b`` under the
        ``FlowMatchScheduler``'s sigma mapping.

        Implementation choices (kept deliberately MINIMAL — paper's
        Section 3.2 plain-SC variant, no mixed-step training, no
        cache-conditioned feature alignment):

          * Single chunk: we always run SC at chunk 0 with a FRESH
            KV cache (sized to ``num_frame_per_block`` frames). This
            avoids polluting the main rollout's cache and keeps the
            cost bounded to 2 DiT forwards on a single 3-frame chunk
            (~1-2% extra wallclock per gen step). The model's chunk-0
            forwards attend to NO prior context (empty cache), so they
            isolate the velocity field's local consistency without
            confounds from earlier-chunk conditioning.

          * Triplet sampled from ``denoising_step_list``: ``t_s, t_m,
            t_e`` are three distinct rungs from the inference grid in
            descending order, broadcast from rank 0 for DDP lockstep.
            Both ``t_s → t_e`` (direct) and ``t_s → t_m → t_e``
            (composed) paths use the model's CLEAN-SPACE prediction
            x0_hat to derive the velocity step (math is exact for
            flow matching with arbitrary ``timestep_shift``; see
            ``_flow_partial_denoise``).

          * Reference clean latent: we noise the FIRST GT chunk
            (``clean_latent[:, :npb]``) to level ``t_s`` to get
            ``x_ts``. The noise is fresh per call. The clean latent
            is detached and never gradient-flowed — it's only the
            base point of the SC defect, not a target.

          * Both forward passes BACKPROP to ``θ`` (no stop-grad on
            either path); the symmetric formulation pulls both
            predictions toward agreement, which is the local
            convergence property the Salt paper proves (Theorem 1).
